# Population genetics of X and Y chromosomes in _Rumex hastatulus_

This repository stores the code, files, and links to the sequence data used in our project investigating X and Y chromosome diversity in  _Rumex hastatulus_.

## Data access

Here are locations of the data on the Capsicum server, for my sanity. Not finished yet (as of July 30). I'll replace these with links to public data repos later.

#### Reference transcriptomes and genomes
+ _R. hastatulus_ transcriptome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/NC_reference```
+ _R. hastatulus_ genome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/``` **[need to get from felix]**
+ _R. bucephalophorus_ transcriptome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/RB_reference```

#### _R. hastatulus_ transcriptome alignments
+ family data:
+ population:
+ CDS alignments:```/cap1/josh.hough/analysis/NCF1```

#### Polymorphism (SNP) data (filtered and unfiltered)
+ family ```/cap1/josh.hough/snps```
+ population ```/cap1/josh.hough/hapcut```

#### Sex-linked and autosomal gene lists
