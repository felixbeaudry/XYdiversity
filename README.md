# Population genetics of X and Y chromosomes in _Rumex hastatulus_

This repository stores the code, files, and links to the sequence data used in our project investigating X and Y chromosome evolution and diversity in  _Rumex hastatulus_

## Data access

Here are locations of the data on the Grandiflora server, for my sanity. I'll replace these with links to public data repos later.

#### Reference transcriptomes and genomes
+ _R. hastatulus_ transcriptome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/Rhastatulus.fa```
+ _R. hastatulus_ genome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/```
+ _R. bucephalophorus_ transcriptome: ```/cap1/josh.hough/```

#### _R. hastatulus_ Transcriptome alignments
+ family data: ```/cap1/josh.hough/```
+ population: ```/cap1/josh.hough/```
+ CDS alignments:```/cap1/josh.hough/```

#### Polymorphism (SNP) data
+ family ```/cap1/josh.hough/```
+ Population ```/cap1/josh.hough/```

#### Sex-linked and autosomal gene lists
